# Error Handling/Validation
Checks the given mac address to see if it follows the specified format of 6 base 16 numbers with commas inbetween them
-- I should probably check for valid interfaces

# Troubleshooting
Double check your mac address by going to a regex website and using the regex pattern "^[0-9A-Fa-f]{2}(:[0-9A-Fa-f]{2}){5}$" and the mac address. See if it matches.
Use wireshark to check what your active interface is.
